# Psychic-Game

I used JavaScript to create a game in which the user has guess what letter the computer has chosen. When the page loads, the computer picks a random letter from an array of the alphabet, and the user has nine attempts the guess the letter correctly. As a user guesses, their guesses appear at the bottom of the page and their number of guesses remaining decrements by one. If they are able to guess the letter correctly, an alert box pop ups congratulating them and once bypassed, the user can play again without having to refresh the page. Additionally, the numbers of wins increments by one. Similarly, if a user cannot guess in the nine attempts, an alert box pops indicating that the game is over and once bypassed, the user can play again. The number of losses increments by one here as well. There are no maximum number of wins or losses, the player can play as many times as desired.
